# Novel Apolipoprotein C-III Isoforms with Potential Therapeutic Implications in Cardiovascular Diseases
Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) plays a crucial role in triglyceride metabolism and is closely associated with cardiovascular disease risk. Elevated APOC3 levels contribute to higher plasma triglycerides and increased risk of atherosclerosis, making APOC3 an attractive therapeutic target. While studying various APOC3 transcript isoforms expressed in hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, Huh7) and healthy liver tissue using publicly available long-read RNA sequencing, we found three novel APOC3 isoforms. The first novel isoform features a canonical splicing pattern and includes exon 4, differing from the known isoform APOC3-203, which utilises cryptic splicing and terminates at exon 3. The second isoform extends exon 1a into the adjacent intronic region and exon 1b, while also containing exon 4. The third isoform closely resembles the MANE transcript, APOC3-201, but lacks exon 2, which contains the protein-coding start site. These isoforms were validated through RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The functions of these new isoforms need to be further investigated to understand the regulation of APOC3 gene expression
